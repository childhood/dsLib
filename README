dsLib is a library of the commonly used data structure and
algorithm. The idea is to provide rich set of APIs to these data
structures which could be used by applications by linking to this
library. It's designed with space and time performace complexity in
mind to be as efficient as possible. It will not solve all data
structure design and performance needs all of the time but some needs
some of the time. There are a rich set of test cases included that
illustrate how the data structure APIs can be used.

This work is still under active development so the paragraph above
should read more like a mission statement for the time being.
